## 1. Background and Motivation
### 1.1 Motivation
Electricity is extremely critical for everyone in modern society, yet traditional network planning often neglect "worst-case" scenarios, focusing instead on daily load growth or single-point failures. This leaves our systems vulnerable to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, which can cause catastrophic, simultaneous outages. Therefore, our primary goal is to prioritize resilience.

To achieve this, we adopt a progressive implementation strategy. We begin by validating the basic grid topology, then move to simulating known disaster paths. Finally, we incorporate uncertainty regarding disaster types and probabilities. By systematically optimizing line hardening and backup generator allocation, this project aims to ensure the continuity of essential services and minimize economic losses when the grid is tested to its limits.
